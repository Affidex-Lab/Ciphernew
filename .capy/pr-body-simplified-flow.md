Summary
- One‑tap wallet creation from the homepage CTA. No multi‑step onboarding.
- Dashboard redesigned to feel like a regular wallet: native balance + user‑added tokens.
- Seed phrase replaced with a simple Recovery Kit: encrypted owner‑key backup protected by a human‑readable Recovery Code. Restore flow included.
- Removed guardian address UI/routes (approve/onboarding) to reduce cognitive load and attack surface.

Why
- Previous flow required generating an owner key, predicting address, deploying, then configuring guardians — too many steps.
- Guardian wallet addresses are confusing to new users and can themselves be compromised.
- This PR keeps the seedless model but replaces guardians with a simpler, self‑contained recovery option that doesn’t rely on third‑party wallets.

What changed
- Landing → CTA now navigates to /dashboard?autocreate=1 and triggers immediate account deployment (sponsored) with locally generated owner key.
- Dashboard
  - Portfolio section: shows native balance and lets the user add ERC‑20 tokens (persisted per chain in localStorage).
  - Recovery section: "Create Recovery Kit" downloads an encrypted JSON backup of the owner key using AES‑GCM. A high‑entropy Recovery Code (e.g., XXXX‑XXXX‑XXXX‑XXXX) derives the key (PBKDF2‑SHA256). "Restore" decrypts and reloads the owner key.
  - Transfer dialog retains the one‑time disposable transfer flow.
- Routes
  - Removed /onboarding and /approve. Access page now offers a direct "Create new" path to /dashboard?autocreate=1.
- Code cleanup: deleted guardian UI and calls (configure, propose/execute recovery, deep‑links) from the app component.

Security notes
- Recovery Kit lives entirely client‑side. The JSON backup is encrypted with AES‑GCM(256); the key is derived from the Recovery Code using PBKDF2‑HMAC‑SHA256 with 200k iterations and random salt. The Recovery Code is never stored.
- This avoids guardian addresses while keeping recovery straightforward. In a future iteration we can add passkey (WebAuthn) wrapping to replace the code with a device‑bound factor.
- No changes to on‑chain contracts in this PR; guardian functionality remains on chain but is not exposed in the UX.

How to try it
1) Open the site and click "Create Seedless Wallet" → account deploys automatically and you land on the dashboard.
2) In Portfolio, add a token by address to view its balance.
3) In Recovery, click "Create Recovery Kit" → save JSON and write down the Recovery Code. Test restore by reloading the app, clearing localStorage, uploading the file, and entering the code.

Follow‑ups (optional)
- Add WebAuthn Passkey backup (P‑256) for recovery without codes (where supported), or multi‑device backup.
- Add token discovery (auto‑detect common tokens) and transaction history.
- Server‑side notifications for deploy/restore status.
