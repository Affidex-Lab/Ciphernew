# Mobile polish + friendlier toasts

This PR improves the mobile experience and replaces remaining alerts with human‑readable toasts while preserving the Status pane for advanced info.

## What changed

Mobile polish
- Header now stacks on small screens across Dashboard, Landing, Access, Approve, Help, and Onboarding pages (flex-col on small, flex-row from sm up).
- Long labels (Network, Account) are truncated with ellipsis and safe max widths to prevent overflow.
- Token list and History rows use min-w-0 + truncate for left content; right values are shrink-0 to avoid wrapping.
- Tokens tab header row allows wrapping so "+ Add" doesn’t overflow on narrow screens.
- Increased bottom padding on Dashboard main (pb-28) so content never hides behind the fixed bottom nav.

Friendlier toasts
- Replaced all remaining window.alert calls with toasts in create, transfer, add token, and recovery flows.
- Kept detailed Status logs unchanged for advanced users.
- Common UX tweaks:
  - Invalid inputs -> info/error toasts.
  - Success messages -> success toasts (e.g., Recovery Kit saved, Token added).
  - “Coming soon” actions -> info toasts.

Files touched
- src/App.tsx
- src/pages/Access.tsx
- src/pages/Approve.tsx
- src/pages/Help.tsx
- src/pages/Landing.tsx
- src/pages/Onboarding.tsx

## Why
- Ensure a clean, readable UI on mobile widths (360×800, 390×844, 414×896) with no overflow.
- Replace technical alerts with friendly, human copy; keep Status panel for power users.
- Reduce friction for common actions (create wallet, transfer, add token, recovery) with clear toasts.

## Impact
- UX enhancement only; no breaking changes.
- Status logs remain for troubleshooting and transparency.

## Verification
- Visually validated stacking/truncation patterns and footer spacing at 360×800, 390×844, 414×896 viewports (Tailwind responsive classes).
- Confirmed toasts appear for the listed flows; Toaster mounted where needed.

## Screenshots (optional)
- If helpful, I can attach screenshots for the three target viewports.
