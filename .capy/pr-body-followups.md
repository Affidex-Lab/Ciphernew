Summary
- Fix account deployment salt generation in browser to resolve “invalid BigNumberish” error (use hexlify(randomBytes(32))).
- Add Passkey Recovery (WebAuthn): create a passkey‑protected recovery kit and restore with device biometric prompt. Code‑based Recovery Kit remains as fallback.
- Token discovery: scan recent ERC‑20 Transfer logs to/from the account and auto‑add discovered tokens to the dashboard.
- Basic local history: record deploys and disposable transfers, update entries when receipts arrive.

Why
- Users on the live site hit an error when tapping Create Wallet due to a salt encoding issue in browsers.
- Passkeys remove the need to remember codes on supported devices, improving usability and security.
- Auto detection and history make the dashboard behave like a familiar wallet.

Notes
- No contract changes; client‑side only. Compatible with EntryPoint and factories as configured.
- Passkey kit is fully offline; no server and no PII stored. Uses platform authenticator with userVerification=required.

How to test
1) Click Create Seedless Wallet — deploy should succeed without errors.
2) Recovery: create a Recovery Kit (code) or Create Passkey Kit, then re‑load and try restoring.
3) Portfolio: click Discover tokens to auto‑populate recent ERC‑20s; balances load per chain.
4) History: perform a disposable transfer; status updates to confirmed once a receipt is available.
