Summary
- Add /onboarding route and page that moves seedless setup out of the dashboard:
  - Generate Owner Key (demo key)
  - Predict and Deploy account via CipherAccountFactory (sponsored via Pimlico)
  - Configure guardians (2-of-3) with configurable recovery delay (hours)
- Update Landing CTA to navigate to /onboarding (dashboard remains for ongoing actions)
- Keep existing /dashboard and /approve flows intact

Why
- Aligns with intended UX: landing with CTAs only; onboarding for initial setup; dashboard for ongoing actions; /approve for guardians.

Details
- src/pages/Onboarding.tsx implements predict/deploy (EntryPoint v0.7) and guardian config using self-call admin paths
- Reuses runtime config (bundlerUrl, entryPoint, accountFactory, policyId) from /config.json or env/localStorage
- Adds recovery delay input (hours), default 48h

Next
- Add QR/success states to /approve and show confirmation counts
- Optional: move Settings into /settings route
- Transaction firewall v1 and tests
