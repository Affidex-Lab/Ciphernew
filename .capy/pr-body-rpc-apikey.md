Summary
- Fix provider RPC usage: use full Bundler RPC URL (including apikey query) for eth_chainId and eth_call based helpers.
- Reason: Pimlico requires the apikey query param; the previous logic trimmed the query string (split('?')[0]), which caused Unauthorized (401) for provider calls and broke chainId detection and getAddress/readRecovery.

Changes
- App.tsx: compute rpc = bundlerUrl (no trimming) and rely on it for getChainId and other provider calls.
- Verified endpoint behavior via curl: https://api.pimlico.io/v2/421614/rpc without apikey returns 401.

Impact
- Dynamic chainId and contract read calls now work when users paste their Pimlico RPC into Settings.
- No breaking changes for existing config flows.

Next steps
- Proceed with routing + dashboard refactor and /approve page.
- Passkey (P‑256) owner path as a follow-up PR.
