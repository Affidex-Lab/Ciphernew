## Cipher Wallet MVP (Contracts + Client + Disposable AA Flow)

Summary
- Add contracts: CipherAccount (ECDSA owner + session keys + guardians + freeze), CipherP256Account (P-256 passkey stub), DisposableAccount (burn-after-execute), DisposableAccountFactory (CREATE2 + address predictor).
- Add client app (Vite/React/TS) with config UI and a working sponsored "disposable one-time tx" flow using Pimlico Bundler + Sponsorship policy.
- Target chain: Arbitrum Sepolia (421614). EntryPoint v0.7: `0x4337084D9E255Ff0702461CF8895CE9E3b5Ff108`.
- Deployed factory (CREATE2): `0xfFa7a8DB30B46cEb36685b01D766fabE298080c1`.
- Netlify config added for monorepo (base=client, publish=dist, SPA redirects).

Why
- Seed-phraseless + privacy-first MVP with disposable one-time accounts reduces wallet-drain risk and transaction linkage.
- Sponsored gas removes the need for test ETH and streamlines onboarding/testing.

Details
- Client flow: predict disposable address via CREATE2, build UserOperation with initCode+executeAndBurn, request sponsorship (`pm_sponsorUserOperation` with policy), sign EntryPoint userOpHash, submit via `eth_sendUserOperation`.
- Config defaults filled for quick testing: Bundler RPC, EntryPoint, Factory, Sponsorship Policy ID.

Testing
- Open the hosted client (Netlify/preview or local), keep defaults, click "Send 0 ETH to target (burn-after-use)". Status log shows estimate → sponsor → sign → send. Account burns after first call.

Next Steps
- Add guardian setup and recovery UI (2-of-3, 48h delay).
- Add transaction firewall policy UI (limits, allowlists, risk flags).
- Optional: enable P-256 validator on a 7212-enabled L2 for passkeys.
