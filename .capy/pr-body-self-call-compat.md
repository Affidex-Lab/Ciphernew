Summary
- Align contracts with the existing front-end encodeSelf flows.
- Add onlySelf guard and *BySelf management functions to CipherAccount:
  - setFrozenBySelf(bool)
  - configureGuardiansBySelf(address[], uint256, uint256)
  - proposeRecoveryBySelf(address)
- Extract shared logic into internal helpers (_configureGuardians, _proposeRecovery) to keep behavior identical across owner/guardian vs self-call paths.

Why
- The web app constructs UserOperations that call account.execute(account, 0, data) to perform management actions via the account contract itself. The contract previously exposed only owner/guardian methods (setFrozen, configureGuardians, proposeRecovery); this mismatch prevented the UI from functioning.
- This change enables owner‑signed userOps to manage the account through the EntryPoint while preserving the existing owner/guardian flows.

Impact
- No breaking changes. Existing external methods remain and behave the same.
- Enables the following UI actions to work as intended:
  - Freeze/unfreeze via setFrozenBySelf
  - Configure guardians via configureGuardiansBySelf (2-of-3, delay)
  - Owner-initiated recovery proposal via proposeRecoveryBySelf
- Recovery execution path is unchanged.

Notes
- Next steps that will further improve UX:
  - Add tests covering the self-call flows via TestEntryPoint.callExecute.
  - Parameterize chain ID in the web app for recoveryId generation instead of hard-coding 421614.
  - Integrate passkey (P-256) account path where supported by EIP-7212.
