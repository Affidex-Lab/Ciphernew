Summary
- Introduce client-side routing with react-router-dom and split flows into pages:
  - / — Landing (hero + CTAs linking into the app)
  - /dashboard — existing dashboard (current App component)
  - /approve — dedicated guardian approval page (Connect wallet → proposeRecovery)
- Keep SPA behavior (Netlify SPA redirect is already configured).

Details
- Added src/AppRouter.tsx as the root router and wired main.tsx to render it.
- Added src/pages/Landing.tsx (marketing hero → nav to dashboard or transfer).
- Added src/pages/Approve.tsx:
  - Reads account and newOwner from query string
  - Connect wallet (BrowserProvider), switches to Arbitrum Sepolia, calls proposeRecovery(newOwner)
  - Copy approval link helper
- Left the existing dashboard logic in App.tsx so no features regress while we stage further refactors (onboarding, settings route, etc.).

Why
- Matches the handoff plan to split landing → onboarding → dashboard and provide a clean /approve entry point for guardians with deep-links.

Next
- Add onboarding route and move seedless key generation + deploy to it
- Add QR rendering to /approve and success states timeline
- Optional: move Settings drawer to /settings (and expose runtime config fields)
